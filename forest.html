        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Deforestation is one of the most critical environmental issues of our time, with far-reaching negative consequences for the environment, climate, and biodiversity.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Deforestation leads to the destruction of unique ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. Forests are home to approximately 80% of the world's wild fauna, and their destruction forces animals, birds, insects, and other species to seek new habitats, often leading to their extinction.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Trees play a crucial role in purifying the air by removing toxic gases, soot, and other pollutants. Without forests, the air becomes more polluted, negatively impacting human health and the health of other living organisms.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Forests absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through photosynthesis. Deforestation leads to the release of stored carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming and climate change.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Tree roots prevent the erosion and weathering of the topsoil. Without forests, the topsoil is destroyed, leading to soil erosion and flooding, as nothing can hold back the water flows.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Forests play a vital role in regulating the water cycle. Trees absorb water through their roots and release it into the atmosphere, maintaining the balance of groundwater. Disrupting this cycle can lead to changes in groundwater levels and the flooding of areas.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Deforestation also has economic and social consequences. It leads to the depletion of natural resources, the loss of traditional income sources for local communities and indigenous peoples, and conflicts between different interest groups.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">Uncontrolled deforestation results in the extinction of individual species of fauna and flora, a reduction in species diversity, and the loss of their natural habitats. More than a million biological species living in tropical forests are under the threat of extinction.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">To minimize the damage from deforestation, it is essential to adhere to the principle of sustainable forest management, based on the balance between forest harvesting and reforestation. This includes planning forest use, strengthening protection and control of resources, improving environmental legislation, and developing a system for monitoring forest cover. It is also important to increase the areas for planting new forests, expand existing ones, and create new protected areas and forest reserves.</p>
